        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
        <p> I am an observational astronomer and instrument scientist with a focus on the direct imaging of exoplanets and brown dwarfs, adaptive optics, and optical interferometry. 
            I am currently a third-year PhD candidate at the Max Plack Institute for Astronomy (MPIA), where I work with Dr. Wolfgang Brandner and Prof. Dr. Laura Kreidberg in the Atmospheric Physics of 
            Exoplanets (APEX) department.
            <br>
            Modern astronomical instruments are extraordinarily complex, operating at the limits imposed by both Earth’s atmosphere and the instruments themselves. 
            My research aims to bridge detailed physical understanding of these systems with advanced numerical techniques, in order to push the sensitivity and fidelity of astronomical observations.
            <br>
            Using these methods, I study the thermal emission of exoplanets and brown dwarfs to probe their atmospheric properties. 
            I am particularly fascinated by the coldest known gas giants—the so-called Y dwarfs—which represent our closest known analogues to Jupiter. 
            These elusive objects are extremley challenging to observe, but occupy a frontier between stars and planets and still harbor many unanswered questions.</p>

              <div class="caption">GRAVITY is a powerful yet highly complex instrument that coherently combines the light from four telescopes, fully exploiting the VLTI’s baselines of up to 130 meters.
                These long baselines enable spatial resolution at milliarcsecond scales, making it possible to directly observe exoplanets located extremely close to their host stars.
                <br>
                Achieving this performance requires GRAVITY to operate by combining many different subsystems, designed to compensate for atmospheric turbulence, optical path-length 
                fluctuations, and other instrumental effects. 
                To quantitatively assess the stability of such a complex instrument, I developed a dedicated simulation framework, SIMTERFERE, which leverages the extensive ancillary and telemetry data 
                recorded during GRAVITY observations.
                <br>
                This framework successfully reproduces the dominant systematic effects observed in the measured coherent flux and provides a testbed for correction strategies. 
                Applying these corrections significantly improves the stability of the data, ultimately pushing the performance of GRAVITY down to the limits set by telluric variability.</div>

              <div class="caption">Detecting exoplanets in the mid-infrared (> 3 µm), where their thermal emission dominates, offers a significant advantage due to the reduced star–planet contrast. 
                However, ground-based observations at these wavelengths are fundamentally limited by the strong thermal background from both the sky and the telescope.
                <br>
                Adaptive Optics (AO) systems mitigate atmospheric turbulence by concentrating the planet’s light into a smaller region on the detector, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
                In this work, however, we find that the AO correction applied to both stellar and planetary light is strongly correlated with temporal variations in the observed spatial background 
                structure.
                <br>
                Our analysis indicates that these correlations are causal and are introduced by the deformable mirror within the AO system. 
                This effect has important implications for sensitivity limits in mid-infrared high-contrast imaging and motivates new strategies for background mitigation.</div>

              <div class="caption">To improve the throughput and Optical Path Difference (OPD) compensation of the GRAVITY instrument at the VLTI, we developed the Beam Compressor Differential Delay 
                Line (BCDDL).
                The BCDDL is a compact, efficient system designed to compensate for differential OPDs between the fringe-tracking and science channels across the VLTI’s four telescopes, while 
                simultaneously compressing the beam to fit within GRAVITY.
                <br>
                I contributed by setting up a comprehensive laboratory testbed to develop the control software, and then to characterize and validate the BCDDL’s performance prior to its integration.
                The system has now been successfully installed in GRAVITY and is routinely used for observations, significantly enhancing the instrument’s overall performance.</div>

              <div class="caption">The squared visibility of an interferometric target encodes spatial information about the object, but it is also directly affected by instrumental effects such as 
                anisopistonic angle errors and residual Optical Path Differences (OPDs). 
                Accurately predicting the expected visibility loss under given observing conditions and parameters is crucial for both observational planning and data evaluation.
                <br>
                In this work, we developed an improved method that combines theoretical models with empirical calibration to predict visibility losses more reliably, enabling better preparation and 
                interpretation of interferometric observations.</div>
